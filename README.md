## Part 2
### Handling Data Gracefully
##### (Jeff Friesen, Co-Founder [Snugg Home](http://snuggpro.com), https://github.com/jefffriesen)
Passing down callback functions or global event listeners get tedious. Facebook developered the Flux library, which was more of a pattern of data flow than a library. Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) built a great implementation of the flux architecture called [Redux](http://redux.js.org).

Demo based on a repo that has already been set up. You can clone it and play with it yourself. The repo has React, Redux, tests, React Router, Babel, Webpack, SASS, Mocha and others:
https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot

If you haven't worked with those libraries, using a starter project like this is a great way to play with them.

Covered in demo:
* Basic
  * How views access data from the store
  * How views call dispatchers to update the store (through a reducer function)
  * How the store is populated with default data
  * Using constants in place of strings for action names

* Slightly Advanced
  * Why the reducer *always* needs to return a new value (reference) instead of mutating it
  * How storing state in [Immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) can make life easier and more fun
  * [MobX](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/) as an alternative to Redux and why MobX should *not* using immutable data in the store
